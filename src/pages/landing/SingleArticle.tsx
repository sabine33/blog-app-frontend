              From the outside it looks like an ordinary corporate building,
              lots of glass and steel, but this factory in the south of the
              Netherlands belongs to ASML, and the machines made there are
              anything but ordinary.

            <p>
              This effective monopoly means that exactly how ASML's machines
              work is subject to some of the most stringent corporate security
              in the world. Nevertheless, we were given a tour of its plant, and
              were guided through the basics.
